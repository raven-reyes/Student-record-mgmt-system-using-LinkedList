# Student-record-mgmt-system-using-LinkedList 
## This project is done using Java programming language.
## This is a student record management system that mimics the operations of linked list which are ; 
## Create new Node which is the same as creating a student record(at the beiginning , end , at any position in the linkedlist).
## Delete Node which is same as deleting a student record (at the beginning , end , at any position in the linkedlist).
## Display linked list Nodes which is same as displaying student records.
## Search a specific node in the linkedlist which is same as searching a specific student record .
## Check if a node already exists in the linkedList which is same as checking if a student record already exist to avoid having duplicate records.
